# YouTube Content Archive

This repository contains structured material from my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@MridunGupta).

Each **playlist, course, or standalone video** is organized into its own **Git branch**.
This makes it easy to follow along with videos, explore code, and reference notes without clutter.
